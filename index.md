## Instructors

__Lecture Instructor__: Joan Bruna ([bruna@cims.nyu.edu](mailto:bruna@cims.nyu.edu))

__Tutors (Parallel Curriculum)__: Will Whitney ([wwhitney@cs.nyu.edu](mailto:wwhitney@cs.nyu.edu)) and David Brandfonbrener ([david.brandfonbrener@nyu.edu](mailto:david.brandfonbrener@nyu.edu))


## Syllabus

This graduate-level course explores some of the open mathematical challenges arising in the study of Deep Learning. In particular, we will focus on three main topics: (i) signal processing principles underpinning convolutional neural networks and their generalisations to non-euclidean geometries (ii) non-convex optimization challenges arising in high-dimensional (or overparametrised) learning problems, and (iii) geometry of Markov Decision Processes and its role in Reinforcement Learning guarantees.

### Parallel curriculum

Besides the lectures, we will also run an optional parallel curriculum during the recitation section on two topics in reinforcement learning (RL). This parallel curriculum builds from the basics of RL to reach seminal modern papers in the field. We will have two segments. The first will lead to [Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6382-unifying-count-based-exploration-and-intrinsic-motivation), covering bandits, deep Q-learning, and exploration along the way. The second will lead to [Guided Policy Search](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-522/15-522.pdf) and cover continuous control, trajectory optimization, imitation learning, and constrained optimization.



<!-- ### Detailed Syllabus 

*  Introduction: the Curse of Dimensionality

* Part I: Geometry of Data
  * Euclidean Geometry: transportation metrics, CNNs , scattering. 
  * Non-Euclidean Geometry: Hausdorff-Gromov distances, Graph Neural Networks. 
  * Unsupervised Learning under Geometric Priors (Implicit vs explicit models, microcanonical, transportation metrics).
  * Applications and Open Problems: adversarial examples, graph inference, inverse problems.

* Part II: Geometry of Optimization and Generalization
  * Stochastic Optimization (Robbins & Munro, Convergence of SGD) 
  * Stochastic Differential Equations (Fokker-Plank, Gradient Flow, Langevin Dynamics, links with SGD; open problems) 
  * Information Geometry and Optimal Transport (Amari, Fisher-Rao metric, Wasserstein) 
  * Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 
  * Landscape of Deep Learning Optimization (Tensor/Matrix factorization, Deep Nets; open problems). 
  * Generalization in Deep Learning.  -->


## Prerequisites

Background on high-dimensional probability, statistics, and/or harmonic analysis. Familiarity with general Machine Learning topics and basic notions of optimization.


## Assignments and Grading

The course will involve weekly required readings before class and a final paper, which will be an in-depth survey of a topic related to the syllabus. A detailed abstract of the final paper will be due in the middle of the term.

The course will be graded in three components: paper abstract, final paper, and participation.
